# Cats house

Go to [Demo](https://kalash14.github.io/dom-homework/) 

It's the first hometask of [Kottans](https://github.com/kottans/) frontend [course](https://github.com/Kottans/frontend).

The task was quite easy for me, but after mentor code review and recommendations I've made some code optimization fixes and was making logic more clean and simple (for example, when user try change cat I used Array.prototype.find method, which is more efficient that checking current id with each cats data items in every loop iteration).
